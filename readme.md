UltraBrainGiftWrap

UltraBrainGiftWrap is a Python class designed to reverse engineer PyTorch model state dictionaries. Given a model file path, it loads the state dictionary, and for each layer in the dictionary, it uses OpenAI's GPT to generate a description of what the layer might represent. This tool aims to assist in understanding and reverse engineering unknown PyTorch models.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
PyTorch
OpenAI Python package
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed.
Install required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install torch openai
Usage
Import the UltraBrainGiftWrap class from the provided script:
python
Copy code
from script_name import UltraBrainGiftWrap
Replace script_name with the name of the Python file containing the UltraBrainGiftWrap class.

Initialize the class with the path to your model and your OpenAI API key:

api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
model_path = 'path_to_your_model.pth'
wrapper = UltraBrainGiftWrap(model_path=model_path, api_key=api_key)
Process the model to obtain reverse engineering instructions:
python
Copy code
instructions = wrapper.process()
print(instructions)
Features
Load state dictionary from a given PyTorch model path.
Extract layer information from the state dictionary.
Use OpenAI's GPT to generate descriptions for each layer based on its name and shape.
Generate comprehensive reverse engineering instructions.
Limitations
The generated descriptions are based on GPT's predictions and might not be accurate for all layers.
Only supports PyTorch model state dictionaries.
